        <div class="info">Welcome to my portfolio project. As you probably know by now, my name is Evan Goddard. I am currently in my first semester of the Master of Science in Finance program at the Brandeis University International Business School with a concentration in FinTech.</div>

        <div class="first"><strong><br><br><br>Merging Tech and Business:</strong><br></div>
<p class="main">I have been captivated by society-transforming technologies for as long as I can remember. As an undergraduate student, I studied financial management and the business model innovations that have operationalized technologies once only imagined in science fiction. My ongoing research on FinTech allows me to converge my lifelong curiosity about technology with an expanding knowledge of finance and management strategies. The decentralized and autonomous nature of well-implemented protocols hold the potential for superior information management on a global scale. For instance, Filecoin incentivizes the creation of decentralized storage by rewarding those who rent out their excess cloud storage. By creating incentives, citizens in countries with high levels of censorship can access mirrors of key information pages like Wikipedia when the centralized counterpart is taken down or banned. I look forward to further studying the potential of distributive ledger technology and the outcomes of existing ventures while completing the MSF program.

        <div class="first"><strong>My Journey Into Web Design:</strong><br></div>
<p class = "main">As someone enthralled with consumer technology and business ventures, I find the process of creating and maximizing the usefulness of technology within an effective business strategy to be a rewarding endeavor. I spent the summer learning web design wireframing software to enhance my design skills. Once comfortable with the software, I utilized my network to find established businesses whose profitability could be further maximized by enhanced web usability and interface. While redesigning existing websites is good practice, I did not have complete design freedom due to the needs of each client. I used creating a personal portfolio website as a catalyst for independent design techniques. While I enjoyed the wireframing process, I longed for the ability to convert designs seamlessly to websites on my own. My curiosity for coding led me to forgo no-code solutions like Webflow in favor of traditional design languages. I plan to use my portfolio website’s wireframe as an opportunity to experiment with and track my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 
    <br><br><br></p>
        <div class="first"><strong>Off the Screen:</strong><br></div>
<p class="main">When I unplug, I spend my time outdoors hiking, running, longboarding, or mountain biking. One of my favorite hiking trips was at Mt. Monadnock with some friends early on a Saturday morning in the summer of 2020. We arrived at the mountain at the break of dawn during torrential rain but were determined to battle to the top. As we climbed, the path slowly grew into a stream, but we continued to hike. When we arrived at the summit, we could not see more than 20 feet ahead due to the fog surrounding us. I lingered at the peak until the wind and rain became intolerable. After trudging back down to the mountain's base, the sun emerged from behind the clouds. By 10 am, it was one of the sunniest days in weeks. While waiting until the storm cleared would have been a less challenging option, I have never regretted hiking in the downpour. The storm's chaos brought another level of excitement and humor to the hike that will forever make this one of my favorite hikes.
